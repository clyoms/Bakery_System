### Assignment 1
1. Problem: Difficulty with handling file reading and writing for CSV files. 
   Solution: I did some research and realised it was a BOM encoding issue, to fix the issue i implemented the line of code "encoding='utf-8-sig'" to fix this issue while reading and appending to csv files

2. Problem: Removing a position and its rates
   Solution: my code wasnt working and i was wondering why and it turned out i had forgotten to implement the rates into the json file and i had also forgotten to check if there were any rates therefore an error was occuring
