## Challenges and Solutions (Assignments 1-3)
[For each assignment, describe at least two problems you faced while creating this program and how you solved them. This helps show your problem-solving skills.]

### Assignment 1
1. Problem: Difficulty with handling file reading and writing for CSV files. 
   Solution: I did some research and realised it was a BOM encoding issue, to fix the issue i implemented the line of code "encoding='utf-8-sig'" to fix this issue while reading and appending to csv files

2. Problem: Removing a position and its rates
   Solution: my code wasnt working and i was wondering why and it turned out i had forgotten to implement the rates into the json file and i had also forgotten to check if there were any rates therefore an error was occuring
   
### Assignment 2
1. Problem: Creating an Employe Class as I hadnt done it before
   Solution: I spent time looking over notes from class to learn how to do it, I also consulted a Youtube Video.

2. Problem: An Issue with searching for the employee ID 
   Solution: I had changed the variable names in the CSV file which led to issues when searching for said variables so an error would occur, I fixed it by chnaging the appropriate variable names.

   Solution: [Explain how you solved it]

2. Problem: [Describe second challenge]
   Solution: [Explain how you solved it]
